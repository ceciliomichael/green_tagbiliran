REPORT STATUS NOTIFICATION IMPLEMENTATION
====================================================================

OVERVIEW:
---------
Implemented automatic notifications to users when an admin updates 
their report status to "resolved" or "rejected".

CHANGES MADE:
-------------

1. Backend (SQL):
   - Created new migration: sql/add_user_notification_support.sql
   - Updated notifications table schema to support 'user' target type
   - Added target_user_id column to notifications table
   - Modified send_notification function to handle user-specific notifications
   - Added validation for user-specific notification parameters

2. Services Layer:
   - Added sendReportStatusNotification method in NotificationAdminOperations
   - Method automatically generates appropriate notification messages based on status
   - Supports custom admin notes in notification messages
   - Handles 3 status types:
     * resolved: "Report Resolved ✓"
     * rejected: "Report Rejected"
     * in_progress: "Report In Progress"

3. UI Layer (Admin Report Detail Screen):
   - Added NotificationsService import
   - Integrated notification sending in _updateReportStatus method
   - Sends notification after successful report status update
   - Only triggers for "resolved" and "rejected" statuses
   - Includes admin notes in notification for context

NOTIFICATION MESSAGES:
----------------------

When status = "resolved":
  Title: "Report Resolved ✓"
  Message: "Your report has been resolved. Admin notes: [notes]"
           (or default message if no notes provided)

When status = "rejected":
  Title: "Report Rejected"
  Message: "Your report has been rejected. Reason: [notes]"
           (or default message if no notes provided)

When status = "in_progress":
  Title: "Report In Progress"
  Message: "Your report is being processed. Update: [notes]"
           (or default message if no notes provided)

IMPLEMENTATION FLOW:
--------------------

1. Admin views report in Admin Report Detail Screen
2. Admin clicks "Update" button
3. Admin selects new status (resolved/rejected) and adds notes
4. Admin confirms the update
5. System updates report status in database
6. System sends notification to the report owner (user_id)
7. User receives notification in their notifications list
8. User can view the notification with admin notes

DATABASE MIGRATION STEPS:
--------------------------

To enable this feature, run the following SQL migration on your Supabase database:

sql/add_user_notification_support.sql

This will:
- Add 'user' to allowed target_type values
- Add target_user_id column to notifications table
- Update send_notification function to support user-specific notifications
- Create necessary indexes for performance

TESTING:
--------

To test the implementation:

1. Admin Login:
   - Log in as admin user
   - Navigate to Reports section
   - Open any pending report

2. Update Report Status:
   - Click "Update" button
   - Change status to "Resolved" or "Rejected"
   - Add admin notes (optional)
   - Click "Update"

3. Verify User Notification:
   - Log in as the user who submitted the report
   - Check notifications (bell icon)
   - Verify notification appears with correct title and message
   - Verify admin notes are included in the message

BENEFITS:
---------

✓ Users are automatically informed when their reports are processed
✓ Users receive context through admin notes
✓ Reduces need for manual follow-up communication
✓ Improves transparency and user experience
✓ Centralized notification system for all status updates
